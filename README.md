# Week 12 Weekend Project - Movie Sagas

## Movie App Features
Hey `"Awesome Junior Development Team"`, we love the app you've started so far. 
Our budget has been approved to add `features`, and we would like to move forward on movie management application. 

### Features we would like to have:
1. We want the Home page to display the movie posters only. 
    - When a user clicks on the movie poster, the movie description displays on a `details` page. 
    Giving it a clean look and showing more movies displayed.

2. We would also like an `Add` movies page. Giving viewers the ability to add more movies. It should have...
    - `Input` field for the movie title.
    - `Input` field for a movie poster URL.
    - `Text` field for entering the movie description.
    - `Dropdown` for selecting genres.
    - `Cancel` button in case they don't want to enter a movie.
    - `Save` button to submit the movie added.
        - Please have the button route them back to the home page!

3. We would really like some more styling and really make the app stand out! Please have...
    - The movie posters displayed in a `card / grid` like system, but feel free to use your best judgement, as we have loved your work in the past and totally trust you.

### Thanks again, you guys are "Awesome"!!!

+ We understand this is a budgetted project and we appreciate your hard work. If there is any time left available, we would like to `stretch` in a few extra features.

1. We would also like to have an `edit` page.
    - `Input` field for changing the movie title for the selected movie.
    - `Text` field to update the movie description.
    - `Cancel` button in case they don't want to enter a movie.
        - We would like the user to be routed to the main page.
    - `Save` button to submit the movie added.

#### Project Notes

+ Friday May 28: 
    - Tonight I took some time just to think about how I wanted to go about this assignment. I struggled a little bit this week trying to get tables to talk to each other and how to properly pull them into a project. This project is going to resemble my solo project on a smaller scale and I want to make sure I have a great working project to use for reference. I read over the requirements of this project and decided that I wanted to go back to getting my readme setup so I can focus on a check list on how I want to acheive everything. This giving me the chance to really plan out how I want everything to look. I've had really good luck working on the front-end of my projects first, so this week I'm going to adjust to that strategy and work on the front end a little, just so I can see how I want things to work as I build the back end. The assignment it really only meant for 2 days, so I'm going to use tonight just to reflect, and think about design. time to rest. Did the npm installs... time to rest.

+ Saturday May 29th:
    - Adjusted the README and re-worded the project layout.
    - I wasn't feeling well today, so I decided to take the day off since we had an extra day to our weekend.

+ Sunday May 20th:
    - First I adjusted the home `movie list` page to have a card like view system. When the user clicks on the poster, it will have the ability to add a function to route to the movie `details` section.
    - Added 2 movies to the DB just to get a better idea how the routes worked.
    - Setup Details page to display using the params method that I'll be using for my solo project.
    - Started the `Add Movies` form, trying to continue using the card setup.

+ Monday May 31st:
    - Corrected CSS cross over issue going from Movie list to Add Movie jsx.
    - Continue working on the `Add Movies` form.
    - Corrected and completed Genre Selector for adding movies.
    - Completed practice, mockups, and ERD.

+ Finished
